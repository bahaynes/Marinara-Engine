/**
 * Game Mode's inventory as stacks.
 *
 * The inventory is a list of stacks, and two stacks may hold the same item: a player can split 300
 * apples into 200 and 100, and both stay apart until the player merges them again. So every stack
 * has an id, and everything that points at ONE stack (the inventory screen) uses it.
 *
 * Every stack is also some ITEM, and every stack of an item agrees on which (`gameInventoryItemId`).
 * A stack keeps the item's own name, the name it was made with, and a rename only gives it a
 * `nickname` to be shown by instead. So identity, merging, totals and fights never follow what the
 * player calls a stack. What names an item (the Game Master's `[inventory: ...]` tag, a fight
 * spending one) finds it by its own name or by any nickname a stack of it has.
 *
 * A stack can also be one of the game's ruleset's items (`item`, "<catalog>/<entry>"), which is then
 * its identity, whatever it is called. A plain item's id is worked out from its own name, so a plain
 * stack stores none. What a ruleset says about its items (which names are its items, how many one
 * stack holds, whether anything else may be added) reaches the changes as `GameInventoryItemRules`.
 *
 * Every stack is in somebody's bag. `holder` names the party member who carries it, as their card
 * names them; a stack without one is the player's own, which is every stack saved before there were
 * bags. The whole list is the shared view, so a bag is simply the stacks with one holder.
 *
 * Every function is pure and returns the same array when nothing changed, so a caller can tell a
 * refused change from an accepted one by reference.
